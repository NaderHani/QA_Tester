## üìÅ Manual Deployment Steps

If you prefer to upload the built files manually:

1. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload the `dist` folder**:
   - The `dist` folder contains all deployment files
   - Upload to any static hosting service:

     - Netlify
     - GitHub Pages
     - Firebase Hosting
     - Cloudflare Pages

## üîß Deployment Configuration

### Vercel Settings (vercel.json)

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

No environment variables needed for basic deployment.

---

## üåê Post-Deployment

After deployment, you'll get a URL like:

- `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
4. Add your custom domain

---

## ‚ú® What Was Fixed

### White Screen Issue Resolution

**Problem**: The app showed a white screen on deployment
**Solution**: Changed `base: "/QA_Tester/"` to `base: "./"`

This ensures assets load correctly regardless of the deployment URL.

### Build Optimization

- Removed source maps for smaller bundle size
- Optimized chunk splitting
- Added proper routing configuration

---

## üìä Build Output

Your project successfully builds to:

- `dist/index.html` (1.00 kB)
- `dist/assets/index-*.css` (~66 kB)
- `dist/assets/index-*.js` (~273 kB)
- Total size: ~340 kB (gzipped: ~88 kB)

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If you see a white screen:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the `dist` folder was deployed, not the root folder
3. Clear browser cache and hard reload (Ctrl + F5)

### If assets don't load:

1. Ensure `base: "./"` is in `vite.config.js`
2. Rebuild the project: `npm run build`
3. Redeploy

### If routing doesn't work:

1. Make sure `vercel.json` is in the root directory
2. For other hosts, configure SPA redirects
